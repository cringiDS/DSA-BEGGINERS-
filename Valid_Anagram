//Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

//An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

// Approach-- Sorting
class Solution{

bool valid_anagram(string s1, string s2) {

//sort both the string with help of member functions provided by containers in C++
sort( s1.begin(), s1.end() );    //.begin returns an iterator pointing to the beginning
sort( s2.begin(), s2.end() );    //.end returns an iterator pointing to the end

//comparing the two sorted strings
return s1==s2;

//WORKING-- Both strings are soted with help of member functions of C++ containers and are compared with equal '==' operator
